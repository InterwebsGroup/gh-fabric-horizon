/*
  Narrow content width for FAQ and large-logo sections on the homepage.

  These selectors use auto-generated Shopify section IDs which are stable
  for the life of each section instance, but will change if a section is
  removed and re-added in the theme editor.

  section_GFiYp7 → FAQ (accordion)
  section_DUGh9D → Large logo / brand story

  A future improvement would be to add a "custom_class" text setting to
  the section schema so these can be targeted by a reusable class instead.
