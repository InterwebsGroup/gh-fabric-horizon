# Giant Hoodies — Marketing Skills Plan

## High Priority — Do These

1. **content-strategy** — Not using at all, should be. Biggest untapped channel.
2. **programmatic-seo** — Should do, haven't started yet.
3. **seo-audit** — Need to dig in and see what's there vs missing.
4. **page-cro** — Should test what we have.
5. **copywriting** — Run it against existing pages, see what it suggests.
6. **copy-editing** — Same pass as copywriting, just the editing lens.
7. **schema-markup** — Uncertain — worth investigating what's actually missing.

## Medium Priority — After the Above

8. **ab-test-setup** — Once high-priority changes are in, test them properly.

## Low Priority — When You Get to It

9. **free-tool-strategy** — Interesting but not urgent.
10. **social-content** — Could do.
11. **paid-ads** — Curious what it says.
12. **form-cro** — Have forms, could test.
13. **product-marketing-context** — Probably already covered by briefing docs.
14. **marketing-ideas** — Browse for inspiration.
15. **marketing-psychology** — Sanity check.
16. **launch-strategy** — Good for next drop or limited release.
17. **pricing-strategy** — Just did it. Run through as a gut check.
