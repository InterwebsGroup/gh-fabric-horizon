# Copy Edit — Giant Hoodies (7 Sweeps)

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

Running all sweeps against homepage, collection page, and product page copy. Copy spec is the brand voice reference.

**Important positioning note:** Giant Hoodies are oversized hoodies, NOT wearable blankets. Do not use "wearable blanket" framing — that's Oodie/Comfy territory. "One size fits most" is correct and used often.

---

## Sweep 1: Clarity

**Issue 1: Slideshow uses explicitly banned copy**
- **Current:** "One size fits most, there's only one size! Maximum comfort, maximum relaxation."
- **Problem:** The copy spec lists "One size fits most, there's only one size!" under Language to AVOID — called out as "redundant, defensive." ("One size fits most" alone is fine and encouraged.)
- **Fix:** "One size fits most. Giant on purpose. That's what makes it a Giant Hoodie."

**Issue 2: Hero subheadline is ambiguous**
- **Current:** "Prices just dropped. This is your sign to get cozy."
- **Problem:** Did prices actually just drop? Is this a sale? Or everyday pricing? A new visitor can't tell.
- **Fix:** Either reference the actual offer ("Starting at $39 when you buy 3+") or use evergreen copy that doesn't imply a temporary event.

**Issue 3: Free Shipping slide starts lowercase**
- **Current:** "for all USA orders over $75, lightning fast from Arkansas. Discounted intl. shipping, too ;)"
- **Problem:** Starts with lowercase "for" which reads like a sentence fragment. The ";)" wink is the only one on the entire site.
- **Fix:** "Free on US orders over $75. Ships lightning fast from Arkansas."

**Issue 4: Typo in bottom section**
- **Current:** "All of our products are printed and fulfilled from Fayetteville, Arkansas with by our incredible team of 5."
- **Problem:** "with by" — extra word.
- **Fix:** "...from Fayetteville, Arkansas by our incredible team of 5."

**Issue 5: "What's a Giant Hoodie?" section name doesn't appear on page**
- The slideshow section is named "What's a Giant Hoodie?" in the Shopify editor but this question never appears as a visible heading. The slides just show "Oversized", "Comfy", "Trendy", "Guaranteed", "Free Shipping" without the framing question.
- **Fix:** Add "What's a Giant Hoodie?" as a visible heading above the slideshow. This is a great question that cold Meta ad traffic is literally asking themselves.

## Sweep 2: Voice & Tone

**Issue 6: "Maximum comfort, maximum relaxation" — spa brochure voice**
- **Current:** Slideshow slide 1 body copy.
- **Problem:** Reads like a massage chair ad, not the warm/casual/friend-recommending-something brand voice.
- **Fix:** "It wraps you in cozy from head to mid-thigh. Giant on purpose."

**Issue 7: "Be confident & stylish" — corporate aspirational**
- **Current:** Slideshow slide 3: "Be confident & stylish with a trendy oversized fit, effortlessly cool at home or out & about."
- **Problem:** "Be confident & stylish" is a command that sounds like a fashion brand tagline, not a friend talking.
- **Fix:** "You'll look effortlessly cool whether you're running errands or lounging at home. It's not just about comfort."

**Issue 8: "Hear from Others!" — generic reviews heading**
- **Current:** Judge.me carousel heading.
- **Problem:** Doesn't match brand voice. Copy spec uses "What the Hoodie Fam Says" for testimonials.
- **Fix:** "What the Hoodie Fam Says"

**Issue 9: "Team of dreamers" — cliché**
- **Current:** Bottom section: "We're a small team of dreamers passionate about creating the softest, most comfortable oversized hoodies in the world."
- **Problem:** "Team of dreamers" is startup boilerplate. The rest of the site is refreshingly un-cliché.
- **Fix:** "We're a team of 5 in Fayetteville, Arkansas who print every hoodie by hand. We love what we do — and we put a handwritten thank-you card in every order."

---

## Sweep 3: So What

**Issue 10: Slideshow slide 1 — "one size" without the why**
- **Current:** "One size fits most, there's only one size! Maximum comfort, maximum relaxation."
- **So what test:** Why is one size a good thing? The copy doesn't answer.
- **Fix:** "One size fits most. That's the whole point — it's designed to be giant on everyone. The most comfortable hoodie you'll ever own."

**Issue 11: Slideshow slide 2 — features without benefit**
- **Current:** "Intentionally oversized with a cozy hood, a classic hoodie kangaroo pocket, and enough room to curl up inside."
- **So what test:** These are physical features (hood, pocket, room). The benefit is the feeling.
- **Fix:** "Enough room to curl up inside. A cozy hood, a kangaroo pocket for your hands, and plush fabric you'll never want to take off."

**Issue 12: Comparison table has no CTA after it**
- After showing Giant Hoodies winning on 6/7 features vs Oodie at half the price, there's no CTA.
- **Fix:** Add a CTA button below the comparison table: "Shop All Hoodies" or "See Why 225,000+ Chose Us"

## Sweep 4: Prove It

Overall **strong**. The site backs up claims well with specific numbers (225K customers, 4.9 stars, <1% returns vs 21% industry, $55 vs $129, team of 5, Fayetteville Arkansas). Press logos provide third-party validation.

**Issue 13: Hero subheadline — unproven claim**
- "Prices just dropped" — Dropped from what? No proof or context.
- **Fix:** If it refers to volume pricing tiers: "Now starting at $39 when you buy 3+." If prices actually dropped recently, add context.

**Issue 14: Bottom section — "softest, most comfortable oversized hoodies in the world"**
- Unearned superlative. Every hoodie brand claims this.
- **Fix:** Let the proof do the work: "We make oversized hoodies that 225,000+ people can't stop wearing."

---

## Sweep 5: Specificity

**Issue 15: Hero headline options**
- "Your New Favorite Oversized Hoodie" is fine as a known tagline. But alternatives worth testing:
  - "7,000+ Designs. One Perfect Level of Cozy." (specific + differentiated)
  - "The Comfiest Hoodie You'll Ever Own" (confident, direct — from copy spec)
  - Keep current (brand consistency)

**Issue 16: Slideshow slide 3 — "effortlessly cool" is vague**
- What makes it cool? Compared to what?
- **Fix:** "You'll get compliments at the grocery store. It's not just for the couch." (concrete scenario, mirrors customer reviews)

---

## Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion

**What works well:**
- FAQ answers are excellent. "If you want to feel like you're wrapped in a cozy blanket, yes." — sensory, direct, confident.
- "Wearing a hug" (fabric FAQ) — perfect emotional language.
- "Treat it right and you'll stay in love for years" — warm.
- "<1% return rate" with "Order → Try It → Love It" flow — clean emotional arc.

**Issue 17: Slideshow is informational, not emotional**
- The 5 slides feel like bullet points turned into slides: Oversized, Comfy, Trendy, Guaranteed, Free Shipping. They describe rather than evoke.
- **Fix — lead each slide with the feeling, not the feature:**
  - "Oversized" → "Imagine slipping into your new favorite hoodie after a long day."
  - "Comfy" → "It's like wearing a hug. That's not us saying it — that's our customers."
  - "Trendy" → "You'll look effortlessly cool, from couch to coffee shop."
  - "Guaranteed" → "225,000+ happy customers. Less than 1% ever return theirs."
  - "Free Shipping" → "Order today, on your doorstep in 3-4 days."

---

## Sweep 7: Zero Risk

**What works:**
- 30-Day Guarantee is prominent (stats bar, guarantee section, FAQ)
- <1% return rate with industry comparison is powerful
- "We'll make it right" is clear resolution language

**Issue 18: No risk reducer near the hero CTA**
- "Shop All Hoodies" button stands alone with no supporting reassurance.
- **Fix:** Add a line below the CTA or as hero bullet points: "Free shipping $75+ · 30-Day Guarantee · Made in USA"

**Issue 19: Comparison table has no CTA (same as #12)**
- After proving you're better than Oodie on every metric at half the price, no path to act.
- **Fix:** Add "Shop All Hoodies" button directly below the table.

## Collection Page Copy

Minimal copy — the main collection page has:
- Banner headline: "Shop Hoodies"
- Banner label: "Cozy Savings"
- Banner accent: "Save Big"
- No description text (empty)

**Issue:** "Cozy Savings" and "Save Big" are generic coupon-speak. Doesn't match the warm brand voice.
- **Fix label:** "Your Hoodie, Your Way" or "7,000+ Designs"
- **Fix accent:** "Starting at $39" or "Buy 2+, Save Big"
- **Fix description:** Add actual copy (covered in pSEO strategy)

---

## Product Page Copy

Most product page copy lives in the section template and is dynamically generated. The key copy elements (trust bar, selling points, FAQ) are solid and match the copy spec well. The main gap identified in the CRO audit: product description ("What is it?") is buried at the bottom below reviews.
