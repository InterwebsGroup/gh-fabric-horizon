## Practical Execution Plan

**Cadence**: 2-3 posts per month. Solo — consistency beats volume.

**Process for each post**:
1. Pick the next topic from the list above
2. Run the **copywriting** skill with the topic + target keyword
3. Run the **seo-audit** skill against the draft for on-page optimization
4. Run the **schema-markup** skill to add Article structured data
5. Publish

**Where to publish**: `/blogs/journal/[post-slug]` (Shopify's built-in blog). Create a blog called "Journal" or "The Hoodie Fam" for on-brand naming.

**Internal linking rules**:
- Every post links to at least 1 product page
- Every post links to at least 1 other blog post (once you have 3+)
- Product pages should link back to relevant blog posts (FAQ answers → care post, sizing concerns → "One Size Fits Most" post)

**Images**: Use existing product/lifestyle photos. Every post should have at least 2-3 images with descriptive alt text containing the target keyword naturally.

---

## What NOT to Write

- Generic "benefits of hoodies" content (too broad, won't rank)
- News/trend pieces that expire quickly (can't keep up solo)
- Content that doesn't connect back to products
- "Top 10 hoodie brands" where you're just listing competitors without a clear angle

## Measuring Success

Track in Google Search Console (free):
- **Impressions**: Are posts showing up in search results?
- **Clicks**: Are people clicking through?
- **Average position**: Are you ranking on page 1-2?
- **Queries**: What actual searches are leading to your content?

Give each post 6-8 weeks to index and start ranking before judging performance.
