A Giant Hoodie is an oversized hoodie. That's it. No zippers, no blanket sleeves, no sherpa body suit. It's a hoodie — hood, kangaroo pocket, ribbed cuffs — just way, way bigger than anything you'd find on a normal rack.

But "oversized hoodie" doesn't quite capture it either. A Giant Hoodie isn't a regular hoodie that got scaled up to 3XL. It's a custom cut-and-sew pattern designed from scratch to be giant on purpose. Every seam, every proportion, every measurement was created so that it drapes, fits, and feels intentionally oversized on every body.

We're Giant Hoodies — a small team of 5 in Fayetteville, Arkansas. We've been making these since 2020 and have shipped to over 225,000 customers. We've been featured on Oprah's Favorite Things, Good Morning America, Forbes, Cosmopolitan, Kelly & Mark, and The View.

This is the full story. What a Giant Hoodie actually is, how it's made, what the fabric feels like, who it's for, and why over 225,000 people have made it their go-to hoodie.

---

## What Makes It "Giant"?

Let's be specific. A Giant Hoodie is roughly equivalent to a 3XL or 4XL in standard sizing — but it's not a 3XL hoodie. That's an important difference.

If you took a regular hoodie pattern and just made it bigger, you'd get something shapeless and weird. The sleeves would be too long. The shoulders would be in the wrong place. The hood would swallow your head. It wouldn't drape right. It would look like you borrowed your older brother's hoodie by accident.

A Giant Hoodie is different. The pattern was designed from the ground up to be oversized. The proportions are intentional. The shoulders sit where they should. The body drapes without looking sloppy. The sleeves are long but not absurd. The hood is sized to match.

The result is a hoodie that looks like a hoodie — just giant. You can [wear it with jeans, leggings, joggers, or bike shorts](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/how-to-style-oversized-hoodie) and look like you meant to dress that way. Because you did.

**[One size fits most.](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/one-size-fits-most-explained)** That means it fits a wide range of bodies — from petite to plus-size — and looks intentionally oversized on everyone. A 5'2" person and a 6'1" person can both wear the same Giant Hoodie and both look great. It just drapes differently.

## The Fabric: 8oz Sponge Fleece

This is one of the most common questions we get: what does it feel like?

A Giant Hoodie is made from 8oz sponge fleece. It's soft, plush, and lightweight. Think of the softest, most broken-in sweatshirt you've ever owned — now imagine it softer and thicker, but without the weight.

Here's what sponge fleece is not: it's not sherpa. It's not flannel. It's not that stiff, scratchy fleece you find in cheap blankets. And it's not thin cotton jersey. It's its own thing — a smooth, plush fabric that customers describe as "wearing a hug."

The 8oz weight means it's substantial enough to feel cozy without being heavy. You won't overheat on a 65-degree day. You won't freeze on a 40-degree morning if you layer underneath. It works year-round, which is one of the biggest reasons people reach for their Giant Hoodie every single day.

The fabric is also what makes the prints pop. Because sponge fleece has a smooth surface, designs print with vivid color and sharp detail — no fading into fuzzy texture like you'd get with sherpa or nubby fleece.

**Important care note:** Sponge fleece is soft because it's a delicate fabric. You need to [wash cold, gentle cycle, and air dry](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/how-to-wash-oversized-hoodie) — no dryer. Treat it right and you'll stay in love for years. We include care instructions with every order, and you can always reference our [care & wash page](https://gianthoodies.com/pages/care-and-wash).

## How Giant Hoodies Are Made

Every Giant Hoodie is printed and packed by hand at our facility in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Not a warehouse overseas. Not a print-on-demand factory you've never heard of. Our shop, our team, our hands.

Here's how it works:

1. **You pick your design** — from over 7,000 options, or [upload your own custom design](https://gianthoodies.com/products/customize-your-own-giant-hoodie).
2. **We print it** — by hand, on-demand, at our Arkansas facility. No mass production. No stockpiling inventory in a warehouse.
3. **We pack it** — every order gets a handwritten thank-you card. Yes, actually handwritten.
4. **We ship it** — most orders go out same or next business day.

Our team is 5 people. That's not a humble brag — it's just the truth. A small team making a really good product, one hoodie at a time.

This is also why we can offer 7,000+ designs. We're not screen-printing bulk runs of 500 units per design. Every hoodie is printed when you order it, which means we can offer designs that big manufacturers can't. If you want a hoodie with your dog's face on it, we can do that. If you want a specific tie-dye pattern, a zodiac design, or a niche meme — it probably already exists in our collection.

Made in the USA isn't just a label for us. It's the whole operation. Learn more about our journey on our [Our Story](https://gianthoodies.com/pages/our-story) page.

## Who Wears Giant Hoodies?

The honest answer? Pretty much everyone.

When we started in 2020, we figured our customer would be a specific type of person. We were wrong. Here's who actually buys Giant Hoodies:

- **College students** who live in them between classes and on the couch
- **Moms** who want something cozy that still looks put-together for school pickup
- **Remote workers** who want to be comfortable on Zoom without looking like they just rolled out of bed
- **Gift givers** — Giant Hoodies are one of our biggest gift categories (see our [best cozy gifts guide](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/best-cozy-gifts-always-cold)). They're easy because one size fits most, and 7,000+ designs means you can find something personal
- **Couples** who buy matching designs (this happens more than you'd think)
- **People with chronic pain or sensory needs** who love the soft, lightweight pressure without heat
- **[Dog people](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/dogs), [cat people](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/cats), plant people, [astrology people](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/zodiac)** — basically anyone with a personality trait they want to wear

If you want an oversized hoodie you can throw on for the airport, the couch, the grocery store, a bonfire, a dog walk, or a lazy Sunday — that's exactly what this is for.

---

## 7,000+ Designs (Plus Custom)

Let's talk about the designs, because this is a big part of what makes Giant Hoodies different.

Most hoodie brands offer somewhere between 10 and 100 designs. We have over 7,000. That's not a typo.

Here's a sample of what you'll find:

- **Animals** — cats, dogs (by breed), horses, butterflies, sea turtles, sloths, frogs, and more
- **Tie-dye & color** — every color combination you can think of
- **Zodiac & astrology** — all 12 signs in multiple styles
- **Food** — pizza, tacos, coffee, ramen, donuts
- **Holidays** — Christmas, Halloween, Valentine's Day, and more
- **Florals & nature** — sunflowers, wildflowers, mushrooms, mountains
- **Retro & vintage** — 70s patterns, 80s vibes, 90s nostalgia
- **Sarcasm & humor** — if it's funny and fits on a hoodie, it's probably here
- **Custom** — upload your own photo, artwork, or design and we'll print it

Every hoodie is printed on-demand, which means we don't have to guess what will sell. If a design exists in our library, it's available right now. No "sold out" on the one you actually wanted.

## The Story Behind Giant Hoodies

Giant Hoodies started in 2020. The idea was simple: make a hoodie that's absurdly oversized, ridiculously soft, and covered in designs that actually mean something to people.

The first hoodies shipped from a small space in Arkansas with a team of two. The idea resonated. People didn't just buy one — they came back for three, four, five. They bought them as gifts. They posted them on social media. They told their friends.

By 2021, we'd been picked for Oprah's Favorite Things. Then Good Morning America. Then Forbes, Cosmopolitan, The View, and Kelly & Mark. Not because we had a PR team — because the product was good and the customers were loud about it.

Today we've shipped to over 225,000 customers. Our return rate is less than 1%. The industry average for apparel is 21%.

We're still in Arkansas. Still a team of 5. Still writing thank-you cards by hand. The hoodie got better, but the operation stayed small on purpose.

---

## Pricing: $55 Each, $39 at 3+

Here's how pricing works:

- **1 Giant Hoodie:** $55
- **3+ Giant Hoodies:** $39 each

No subscriptions. No membership fees. No weird pricing tricks. You buy hoodies, we make hoodies.

The volume pricing is real — $39 each when you buy 3 or more. That's $117 for three oversized hoodies. For context, a single Oodie costs around $129. (We did a [full Giant Hoodies vs Oodie comparison](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/giant-hoodies-vs-oodie) if you're deciding between the two.)

**Free shipping** on orders over $75. Most orders ship same or next business day from Arkansas and arrive in 2-3 days within the US.

## The "Best Hoodie Ever" Guarantee

We call our return policy the "Best Hoodie Ever" Guarantee. Here's what it means:

If you're not 100% happy with your Giant Hoodie within 30 days, we'll make it right. Exchange it, replace it, or refund it. No hoops. No hassle.

We can afford to offer that because almost nobody uses it. Our return rate is less than 1%. When 99 out of 100 customers keep their hoodie, that tells you something about the product.

225,000+ customers. Less than 1% returns. The industry average is 21%.

## What Giant Hoodies Are Not

This is worth saying clearly, because the oversized hoodie category has gotten confusing.

**Giant Hoodies are [not wearable blankets](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/wearable-blanket-vs-oversized-hoodie).** We're not the Oodie. We're not The Comfy. Those are great products for what they are — thick, heavy, sherpa-lined blankets you wear on the couch. But they look like blankets, they feel like blankets, and you wouldn't wear them to Target.

A Giant Hoodie is a hoodie. It has a normal hoodie silhouette — just bigger. You can wear it out of the house without getting a single weird look. You'll probably get compliments instead.

**Giant Hoodies are not scaled-up regular hoodies.** We didn't take an existing pattern and make it 3XL. Our cut-and-sew pattern was designed from scratch to be oversized. The proportions, the drape, the fit — it's all intentional.

**Giant Hoodies are not "one size fits all."** We say "one size fits most" because that's the truth. It fits a very wide range of bodies — and it's designed to look oversized on everyone — but we don't pretend a single size works for literally every person on the planet.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is a Giant Hoodie?</h3>
<p>A Giant Hoodie is an oversized hoodie made from 8oz sponge fleece with a custom cut-and-sew pattern designed to be giant on purpose. It's not a wearable blanket. It's not a scaled-up regular hoodie. It's a hoodie — hood, kangaroo pocket, ribbed cuffs — just intentionally, ridiculously oversized. Made in the USA with 7,000+ designs available.</p>

<h3>What size is a Giant Hoodie?</h3>
<p><a href="/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/one-size-fits-most-explained">One size fits most</a>. A Giant Hoodie is roughly equivalent to a 3XL/4XL, but it's designed from scratch as an oversized garment — not a regular hoodie made bigger. It fits a wide range of bodies and looks intentionally oversized on everyone, from petite to plus-size.</p>

<h3>Is a Giant Hoodie the same as a wearable blanket?</h3>
<p>No. Wearable blankets (like the Oodie or The Comfy) are thick, sherpa-lined garments designed for the couch. A Giant Hoodie is a soft fleece oversized hoodie you can wear anywhere — errands, the airport, school, brunch, a bonfire. It looks like a hoodie, not a blanket. We break down the differences in our <a href="/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/giant-hoodies-vs-oodie">Giant Hoodies vs Oodie comparison</a>.</p>

<h3>What fabric are Giant Hoodies made from?</h3>
<p>8oz sponge fleece — soft, plush, and lightweight. Customers describe it as "wearing a hug." It's cozy without being heavy, so it works year-round. The smooth surface also gives prints vivid color and sharp detail.</p>

<h3>How do you wash a Giant Hoodie?</h3>
<p>Cold water, gentle cycle, air dry. No dryer. Sponge fleece is soft because it's delicate, so it needs gentle care. Follow the instructions and it'll stay soft and vibrant for years. We wrote a full guide on <a href="/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/how-to-wash-oversized-hoodie">how to wash your oversized hoodie</a>.</p>
