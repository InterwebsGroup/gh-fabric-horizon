If you're looking at oversized hoodies, you've probably come across two names: Giant Hoodies and the Oodie. Both are popular. Both promise ultimate coziness. But they're actually very different products — and the right one for you depends on what you're looking for. (For a broader comparison that includes other brands too, check out our [best oversized hoodies 2026](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/best-oversized-hoodies-2026) roundup.)

We're Giant Hoodies, so yes, we're biased. But we're going to be honest about both products, because the best way to earn your trust is to tell the truth. Here's a real side-by-side comparison.

---

## The Quick Version

If you're in a hurry, here's the summary:

| | Giant Hoodies | Oodie |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | $55 ($39/each at 3+) | ~$129 |
| **Fabric** | 8oz sponge fleece | Sherpa fleece lining, flannel outer |
| **Weight** | Lightweight, breathable | Thick and heavy |
| **Sizing** | One size fits most | One size |
| **Designs** | 7,000+ | 100+ |
| **Custom Option** | Yes | No |
| **Made In** | USA (Arkansas) | China |
| **Wear Outside?** | Yes — looks like a normal hoodie | Not really — clearly loungewear |
| **Best For** | Everyday wear, all seasons | Cold-weather couch sessions |

Now let's break it down.

---

## Price: $55 vs $129

This is the most obvious difference. A Giant Hoodie costs $55. An Oodie costs around $129.

That means you could buy two Giant Hoodies for less than one Oodie. And if you buy 3+, the price drops to $39 each — that's three Giant Hoodies for $117, still less than a single Oodie.

The Oodie does run frequent sales and promotions, so you might catch it for less. But at full price, the gap is significant.

**Our take:** Both products are well-made for what they are. But $74 is a big price difference, especially when you look at everything else on this list.

---

## Comfort & Fabric: Two Very Different Approaches

This is where the products really diverge. They're both "oversized hoodies," but the fabric and feel are completely different.

**Giant Hoodies** use 8oz sponge fleece — it's soft, plush, and lightweight. Think of your favorite broken-in sweatshirt, but softer and bigger. Customers describe it as "wearing a hug." It's cozy without being heavy, which means you can wear it year-round. You won't overheat in the spring or on a mild winter day. Want to know more about what makes this fabric different? We break it down in [what is a giant hoodie](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/what-is-a-giant-hoodie).

**The Oodie** uses a sherpa fleece lining with a flannel outer shell. It's thick, heavy, and seriously warm. Like wearing a stuffed animal. If you're always freezing, that's a plus. But it's also a trade-off — it's not something you'd want to wear in anything above 60 degrees. For more on this distinction, see our guide to [wearable blankets vs oversized hoodies](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/wearable-blanket-vs-oversized-hoodie).

**Our take:** If you want warmth above all else and only plan to wear it indoors during cold months, the Oodie delivers. If you want something soft and comfortable that works year-round and in more situations, Giant Hoodies is the better pick.

---

## Style: Can You Wear It in Public?

This is the question that matters most to a lot of people. And it's where the two products are most different.

**Giant Hoodies** look like an oversized hoodie. That's it. The silhouette is a classic hoodie shape — hood, kangaroo pocket, standard proportions, just bigger. You can pair it with jeans, leggings, or joggers and look completely put together. You'll get compliments at the grocery store, not weird looks. (Need outfit inspo? We put together a whole guide on [how to style an oversized hoodie](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/how-to-style-oversized-hoodie).)

**The Oodie** looks like loungewear. The puffy sherpa material, the extra-wide body, the blanket-like proportions — it's designed for the couch, and it looks like it. It's great at home, but most people wouldn't wear it to grab coffee or run errands. That's not a criticism — it's just a different product for a different purpose.

**Our take:** If you want something you can throw on and walk out the door — airport, dog walk, brunch, Target run — Giant Hoodies is what you want. If you're buying strictly for couch and bed? The Oodie works.

---

## Design Selection: 7,000+ vs 100+

This one isn't close.

**Giant Hoodies** offers over 7,000 design and color combinations. [Cats](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/cats), [dogs](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/dogs), tie-dye, [zodiac signs](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/zodiac), [retro patterns](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/retro), florals, [food](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/food), holidays, [sarcasm](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/sarcasm), [pop culture](https://gianthoodies.com/collections/pop-culture), space — you name it. Plus a [custom option](https://gianthoodies.com/products/customize-your-own-giant-hoodie) where you can upload your own design. Every hoodie is printed by hand at our facility in Arkansas, so we can offer designs that mass-production can't.

**The Oodie** has around 100+ designs, mostly fun prints and licensed collaborations. The selection is decent, but if you want something specific or unique, your options are limited.

**Our take:** If you're the kind of person who wants a hoodie that matches your personality — not just a generic pattern — 7,000+ options vs 100+ is a significant difference.

---

## Quality & Durability

Both products are well-made, but they require different care.

**Giant Hoodies** are printed on 8oz sponge fleece. It's soft and plush, but it's a delicate fabric — you need to wash cold, gentle cycle, and air dry (no dryer). Treat it right and you'll stay in love for years. Treat it rough and the print and softness will degrade. We include care instructions with every order and there's a [full care guide on our blog](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/how-to-wash-oversized-hoodie).

**The Oodie** is thicker and more durable in terms of abuse tolerance. The sherpa material can handle a bit more, though it can still pill over time. The bulk makes it harder to wash and dry.

**Our take:** Both will last if you follow the care instructions. Giant Hoodies require a bit more care because of the fleece, but the trade-off is a softer, lighter fabric.

---

## Shipping & Returns

**Giant Hoodies** ships from our facility in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Most orders ship same or next business day and arrive in 2-3 days within the US. Free shipping on orders over $75. We include a handwritten thank-you card in every box.

**The Oodie** ships from Australia (their home base) with international fulfillment centers. US shipping typically takes 5-12 business days. Free shipping is offered on most orders.

**Giant Hoodies** has a 30-day "Best Hoodie Ever" Guarantee — if you're not happy, we'll make it right. Our return rate is less than 1% (the industry average is 21%).

**The Oodie** offers a 30-day return policy with some conditions.

**Our take:** If you're in the US, Giant Hoodies wins on speed. A handwritten thank-you card doesn't affect the product, but it says something about the company behind it.

---

## Made in USA vs Imported

**Giant Hoodies** are printed and packed by hand at our facility in Northwest Arkansas by a team of 5. Every order.

**The Oodie** is manufactured in China and shipped globally from international warehouses.

If buying American-made matters to you, Giant Hoodies is one of the few oversized hoodie brands that can say that honestly. Learn more about [our made-in-USA story](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/made-in-usa-hoodies-arkansas).

## Common Questions

**Is Giant Hoodies an Oodie alternative?**
Yes and no. Giant Hoodies and the Oodie are both oversized, but they're different products. Giant Hoodies is a soft fleece oversized hoodie you can wear anywhere. The Oodie is a thick sherpa wearable blanket designed for lounging. If you're looking for an Oodie alternative that's lighter, more versatile, and less expensive, Giant Hoodies is exactly that.

**Is the Oodie worth $129?**
The Oodie is a well-made product. Whether it's worth $129 depends on what you want. If all you need is maximum warmth for the couch, it delivers. But if you want something you can wear out, in more seasons, with more design options, at a lower price — there are better options.

**Can you wear a Giant Hoodie to bed?**
Absolutely. The lightweight fleece actually makes it better for sleeping than thick sherpa blanket hoodies, which can cause overheating. A lot of customers wear theirs to bed. If you prefer something simple for sleeping, our [Original Giant Hoodie](https://gianthoodies.com/products/blank-giant-hoodie) in a solid color is a great pick.

**Which is softer — Giant Hoodies or the Oodie?**
Different kinds of soft. Giant Hoodies' sponge fleece is a smooth, plush soft — like your favorite broken-in sweatshirt elevated. The Oodie's sherpa is a fuzzy, nubby soft — more like a stuffed animal. Most people find the fleece more comfortable for extended wear.

**Do Giant Hoodies run sales?**
Our everyday pricing is already competitive — $55 each, or $39 each when you buy 3+. We occasionally run flash sales with even better prices. The best way to catch them is to [join the Hoodie Fam](https://gianthoodies.com/#footer) and get notified.

## The Bottom Line

Giant Hoodies and the Oodie are both good products — but they're good at different things.

If you want an oversized hoodie that's soft, lightweight, stylish enough to wear in public, available in thousands of designs, made in the USA, and costs less than half the price — **Giant Hoodies is the clear pick.**

If you want a thick, heavy, sherpa-lined wearable blanket strictly for cold indoor lounging and you're okay paying $129 for it — the Oodie does that well.

For most people? The hoodie you can actually wear every day, everywhere, is the one you'll get the most value from. Looking for a gift? Giant Hoodies are also one of the [best cozy gifts](/blogs/the-hoodie-blog/best-cozy-gifts-always-cold) for someone who's always cold.
