---

## Prompt Template

Generate a photorealistic lifestyle photograph for a blog featured image. The image must look like an editorial photo taken by a professional photographer with a mirrorless camera — natural lighting, shallow depth of field, warm color grading. Not AI-looking, not illustrated, not 3D rendered.

### REFERENCE IMAGE — MUST MATCH EXACTLY

I am attaching a product image of the actual hoodie. This is the EXACT hoodie that must appear in the generated image. You MUST match the following from the reference image with zero deviation:

- **Shape & silhouette:** Reproduce the exact hoodie shape — the hood style, the kangaroo pocket, the body proportions, the sleeve length, the ribbed cuffs and hem. Do not alter, simplify, or reinterpret the garment shape in any way.
- **Size & oversized fit:** The hoodie must be the same level of oversized as shown in the reference — same drop shoulders, same body length, same overall drape. Do not make it smaller, tighter, or more fitted. Do not make it puffier or blanket-like either.
- **Construction details:** Reproduce the seams, stitching lines, pocket placement, drawstring, and any other visible construction details exactly as shown. Do not add zippers, buttons, toggles, or any features not present in the reference.
- **Fabric texture:** Match the fabric texture from the reference — the sponge fleece surface, the way it catches light, the weight and drape of the material. Do not substitute sherpa, sherpa-lined, quilted, nylon, or any other fabric.
- **Color:** Match the exact color of the hoodie in the reference image. Do not shift the hue, saturate it differently, or substitute a different color unless the scene prompt specifically says otherwise.

**NON-NEGOTIABLE:** If anything in the scene description below conflicts with the reference image (e.g., the scene says "bold print" but the reference is a solid color), the REFERENCE IMAGE always wins. The hoodie in the final image must be indistinguishable from the reference in shape, size, color, and construction.

### Subject & Scene

Read the blog article below and generate a single hero image that matches the article's topic. Follow these rules exactly:

**DO:**
- Show a real-looking person (mid-20s to mid-30s) wearing the exact hoodie from the reference image
- Shoot full body or 3/4 body so the oversized fit is visible
- Place the person in a real, lived-in setting that matches the article topic (couch, coffee shop, sidewalk, park, kitchen, doorstep — whatever fits)
- Use warm, natural lighting (golden hour, window light, or soft overcast)
- Make it feel candid and authentic — like a real customer photo, not a catalog shoot
- The person should look comfortable and happy, not posed or stiff

**DO NOT:**
- Do not alter the hoodie's shape, size, color, fabric, or construction from the reference image
- Do not include any text, logos, watermarks, or brand names on the image
- Do not show the hoodie as a flat lay or product-only shot
- Do not make the hoodie look like a blanket, robe, or sleeping bag
- Do not use studio lighting or white/gray backgrounds
- Do not add borders, frames, collage layouts, or split screens
- Do not show multiple outfit options or before/after comparisons
- Do not include hands holding phones, laptops, or screens
- Do not generate cartoon, illustration, or anime styles

### Aspect Ratio & Composition

- Aspect ratio: 16:9 (landscape, standard blog hero)
- The subject should be roughly centered or slightly off-center (rule of thirds)
- Leave some breathing room around the subject — not cropped too tight
- The background should be slightly blurred (bokeh) to keep focus on the person and hoodie

### Color & Mood

- Warm tones: soft golds, warm whites, muted earth tones
- Cozy, inviting, approachable mood
- The hoodie color must match the reference image exactly — do not recolor it to match the scene's mood

### BLOG ARTICLE (paste the full article below):

```
[PASTE YOUR BLOG ARTICLE TEXT HERE]
```

### Post-Specific Override (optional)

If the blog article's featured image description calls for something specific that differs from the defaults above (e.g., "show a kid," "show a group of people," "show someone gifting a hoodie," "show a behind-the-scenes facility photo"), follow the article's description instead. The article's **Featured image:** field takes priority over the general rules above. However, the hoodie itself must STILL match the reference image exactly — scene can change, hoodie cannot.
