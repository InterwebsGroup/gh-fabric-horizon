## Core Messaging

### The Big Idea

**Giant Hoodies are wearable blankets.**

They're not about "fit" in the traditional sense. They're about being COVERED. Cozy. Wrapped up. Protected from the world.

One Size Fits Most because the whole point is to drown in comfort — not to look tailored.

### Primary Value Proposition

**Your one hoodie for everything.**

- Cozy night on the couch
- Laundry day when everything's in the wash  
- Airport travel when it's freezing
- Movie theater when the AC is blasting
- Weekend morning coffee
- Work from home uniform
- "I just need to run to the store" outfit

Once you own one, you'll understand. And you'll be back for more.

### Key Messages (Priority Order)

1. **Comfort/Cozy** — The softest, coziest hoodie you'll ever own
2. **Versatility** — Your hoodie for everything, everywhere
3. **Value** — Save $20+ today, more when you buy multiple
4. **Social Proof** — 225,000+ happy customers, 4.9 stars
5. **Trust** — Made in USA, 30-day guarantee, fast shipping
6. **Selection** — 7,000+ designs to match your personality

## One Size Fits Most — Messaging Guide

### The Concept

"One Size Fits Most" is NOT about traditional sizing. It's about the wearable blanket experience.

- Internal sizing: Similar to 3XL/4XL
- The point: To COVER you, not to FIT you
- Who it's for: Anyone who wants to be wrapped in cozy

### Approved Language

**Primary (use most often):**
> "One Size Fits Most. That's the whole point — it's a wearable blanket, not a fitted shirt."

**Short version:**
> "One size. Giant on purpose."

**Explanatory:**
> "Our hoodies are intentionally oversized to wrap you in comfort. Similar to a 3XL, but designed to be cozy on anyone from petite to plus."

**FAQ style:**
> "Will it fit me? If you want to feel like you're wrapped in a cozy blanket, yes. That's the point. It's oversized for everyone — that's what makes it giant."

### Language to AVOID

- ❌ "One size fits most, there's only one size!" (redundant, defensive)
- ❌ "Intentionally oversized for most, and a good fit to some" (confusing)
- ❌ "Fits sizes XS-3XL" (implies traditional fit, misses the point)
- ❌ "May be large on smaller frames" (sounds like a warning)

- Don't repeat the same CTA more than twice on a page
- Don't use ALL CAPS except for very short emphasis
